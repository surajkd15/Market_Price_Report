# Market_Price_Report
Here, the problem statement revolves around prediction of prices for the crop Potato in District “Agra” in the state of Uttar Pradesh across year 2020.

The historical data for prices in district “Agra” of state “Uttar Pradesh” are reported daily on Agmarknet. I exported the data in excel format and then loaded it in Jupyter Notebook.

I plotted the graphs for the pattern of prices for each market.

I have answered some questions about how I can leverage machine learning to predict prices for a given market in Agra for the crop 'Potato'.
